    // Gaze Tracker section
    "gaze-title": "Gaze Tracker",
    "gaze-description": "Control your device hands-free using advanced face tracking technology. Move the cursor with head movements and click with simple winks.",
    "gaze-top": "How It Works",
    "gaze-explained": "Our innovative gaze tracking system uses your device's front camera to monitor your face movements and eye gestures. Simply move your head to control the cursor position, and wink to perform clicks.",
    "gaze-features": "Key Features:",
    "gaze-feature-1": "• Hands-free cursor control through head movements",
    "gaze-feature-2": "• Click actions through wink detection",
    "gaze-feature-3": "• Smooth and responsive tracking",
    "gaze-feature-4": "• Customizable sensitivity settings",
    "gaze-calibration": "Calibration Process",
    "gaze-step1-title": "Step 1: Motion Calibration",
    "gaze-step1-desc": "Follow a moving target on the screen using your head movements. This step teaches the system to recognize your natural head motion patterns and maps them to cursor movement. Keep your face visible to the camera and move smoothly to achieve the best results.",
    "gaze-step2-title": "Step 2: Click Calibration", 
    "gaze-step2-desc": "Control the cursor and position it inside the green target circles that appear on screen. Once positioned correctly, wink and hold for at least 2 seconds. This process is repeated five times for different coordinate positions. For optimal results, try to look directly at the camera while performing the wink gesture.",

    "length-title": "Length Measurement",
    "length-description": "Transform your device into a precise measuring tool. Track displacement and calculate accurate length measurements for any object or distance.",
    "length-top": "Precise Measurements",
    "length-explained": "Using advanced motion tracking algorithms, Smart Kit can accurately measure the length of objects by tracking your device's displacement along the measurement path.",
    "length-features": "Key Features:",
    "length-feature-1": "• High precision length calculations",
    "length-feature-2": "• Real-time displacement tracking",
    "length-feature-3": "• Support for various measurement units",

    "length-step-reference": "Reference Object Setup:",
    "length-step-reference-desc": "Find an object with a known length (like a ruler, book, or standard paper). Enter the exact length of this reference object into the calibration text field within the app.",
    "length-step-measurement": "Calibration Measurement:",
    "length-step-measurement-desc": "Tap \"Start Calibration\" and carefully move your device along the entire length of the reference object, from one end to the other. Maintain steady movement for the most accurate calibration. The app will use this reference to calibrate all future length measurements.",

    // Angle Measurement section
    "angle-title": "Angle Measurement",
    "angle-description": "Accurately measure tilt angles and inclinations using your device's built-in sensors. Perfect for construction, design, and everyday angle measurement needs.",
    "angle-top": "Professional Accuracy",
    "angle-explained": "Leverage your device's gyroscope and accelerometer to provide precise angle measurements. Whether you're checking if a picture is straight or measuring slopes, Smart Kit delivers reliable results.",
    "angle-features": "Key Features:",
    "angle-feature-1": "• 360-degree angle measurement capability",
    "angle-feature-2": "• Real-time tilt angle display", 
    "angle-feature-3": "• Multiple angle units (degrees, radians)",
    "angle-feature-4": "• Visual angle indicators and guides",
    "angle-calibration": "Calibration Process",
    "angle-step1-title": "Step 1: 0° Calibration (Horizontal)",
    "angle-step1-desc": "Place your device on a perfectly flat, horizontal surface or against a level wall. This establishes the baseline horizontal reference point for all angle measurements.",
    "angle-step2-title": "Step 2: 90° Calibration (Vertical)",
    "angle-step2-desc": "Position your device vertically against a wall or use a reliable vertical reference. This step calibrates the perpendicular angle reference, ensuring accurate right-angle measurements.",
    "angle-step3-title": "Step 3: 180° Calibration (Inverted Horizontal)",
    "angle-step3-desc": "Flip your device to the opposite horizontal orientation (180° from the first position). This can be achieved by placing it flat on a surface with the screen facing down, or against a wall in the inverted position. This final step completes the full calibration cycle for maximum accuracy across all angles.",
